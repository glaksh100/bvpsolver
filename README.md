bvpsolver
=========

A term project to build a O(n) bvp solver

The folder contains different Python files. The aim of th project was to build a fast bvp solver using the following parts:

Part 1:
Here the algorithm for Arnoldi iteration was developed in order to solve a linear system of equations.

Part 2:
Here, the analytical solution for a BVP was derived by using a density function as the representation of the solution

Part 3:
Here, a second order BVP solver was build

Part 4:
Here, the integrating polynomials were discretized as piecewise polynomials

Part 5:
A first order BVP solver was built
